# e-commerce-backend13
This week, we were assigned to complete the back end connectivity for an E-commerce application. This wasn't too strenuous this time around but there were a couple of challenging moments. From a previous project, I'd left the application connected to the mySQL server so learning how to disconnect and reconnect applications to the appropriate ports was definitely an interesting task. I had a great time overcoming this obstacle and learned a lot, I am excited for whats to come!
